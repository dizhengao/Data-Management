%There should be a metadata file in each of the folder, this can be either a txt file %(recommend) or any type of file that best suits the demands, and it should describe:
%- Time of the experiments
%- Protocol of the experiments, including any special treatment.
%- [optional] The hypothesis/objective of the experiments
%This file will be directly appended into the 3.Results.tex after each experiment is finalised by running
